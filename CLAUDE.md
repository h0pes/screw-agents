# CLAUDE.md — screw-agents

## Project Identity

**screw-agents** is a modular, AI-powered secure code review system. It provides dedicated, vulnerability-specific agents that carry deeply researched security knowledge (from OWASP, CWE, CAPEC, Semgrep rules, real CVEs, security research blogs) and are invocable from Claude Code, Neovim (via screw.nvim), or CI/CD pipelines through a shared MCP server backbone.

**Repository:** `github.com/h0pes/screw-agents`
**Owner:** Marco (h0pes)
**Language:** Python (MCP server), Markdown (Claude Code agents/skills), YAML (agent definitions)
**Package manager:** `uv` (preferred). Do NOT use bare `pip install` — use `uv`, `uvx`, or `pipx`.

## Current State

**Phase:** Pre-implementation. Architecture and product design phase is complete.
**PRD:** `docs/PRD.md` (v0.4.3, ~1,430 lines) — the comprehensive product requirements document. READ THIS FIRST for full context on architecture, taxonomy, features, and implementation plan.
**Next milestone:** Phase 0 — Knowledge Research Sprint (collecting and synthesizing security knowledge for agent YAML definitions).

## Architecture Overview (Quick Reference)

Read `docs/PRD.md` §3 for the full architecture. Key points:

- **MCP server** (`src/screw_agents/`) is the pluggable backbone. All intelligence lives here.
- **Claude Code integration** (`plugins/screw/`) provides subagents, skills, and slash commands — thin orchestration wrappers calling MCP tools.
- **Agent definitions** (`domains/`) are YAML files carrying vulnerability-specific detection knowledge. This is where the real value lives.
- **CWE-1400** (Comprehensive Categorization, 21 categories consolidated to 18 agent domains) is the taxonomic backbone. Not OWASP Top 10, not ad-hoc categories. See `docs/DECISIONS.md` §2 for why.
- **OWASP Top 10:2025** (not 2021) is the risk communication overlay, not the structural backbone.
- **screw.nvim** integration stays in the screw.nvim repo. This repo does NOT contain Lua code.

## Key Design Decisions (Summary)

Full reasoning in `docs/DECISIONS.md`. The critical ones:

1. **MCP server, not embedded prompts** — Portability across Claude Code, screw.nvim, and CI/CD.
2. **MCP over code-execution agents** — The system delivers curated knowledge, not API wrappers. Context cost is ~800-1,200 tokens (6-8 tools), not 20k+.
3. **CWE-1400 taxonomy backbone** — Only classification with completeness + mutual exclusivity + practical granularity. Every finding carries a CWE ID as universal join key.
4. **YAML agent definitions, not hardcoded prompts** — Community extensibility. New vulnerability types via YAML, no Python code changes.
5. **Autoresearch self-improvement loop** (Karpathy-inspired) — Agents iteratively refine their own YAML against SAST benchmarks. Human review gate on all changes.
6. **Multi-LLM challenger** — Provider-agnostic interface; Codex (via codex-plugin-cc) is first implementation. Opt-in, never default.
7. **`uv` as package manager** — pip install is restricted on Arch Linux and similar. Always prefer `uv` / `uvx`.

## Coding Standards

### Python (MCP server)
- Python 3.11+
- Use `uv` for dependency management. `pyproject.toml` for package definition.
- Type hints on all function signatures
- Async where the MCP protocol requires it
- tree-sitter for AST parsing (target resolution)
- No heavy frameworks — FastMCP or similar lightweight MCP library for the server

### YAML (Agent definitions)
- Follow the schema defined in `docs/PRD.md` §4 exactly
- Every agent MUST include: `meta` (CWEs, CAPEC, OWASP mappings, sources with last_checked dates), `core_prompt`, `detection_heuristics`, `bypass_techniques`, `remediation`, `few_shot_examples`, `target_strategy`
- Detection heuristics must be language-specific and precise, not generic

### Markdown (Claude Code agents/skills)
- Subagents in `plugins/screw/agents/` follow Claude Code's agent format with YAML frontmatter
- Skills in `plugins/screw/skills/` follow the SKILL.md format with frontmatter

## Repository Structure

See `docs/PRD.md` Appendix C for the full tree. Key directories:

```
screw-agents/

├── src/screw_agents/       # MCP server (Python)
├── domains/                # Agent YAML definitions (the knowledge base)

└── docs/                   # PRD, decisions, guides
```

## What NOT to Do

- Do NOT use OWASP Top 10 as the domain structure. Use CWE-1400. Top 10 is for reporting only.
- Do NOT reference OWASP Top 10:2021. The current version is 2025.
- Do NOT use `pip install` directly. Use `uv`, `uvx`, or `pipx`.
- Do NOT build screw.nvim integration code in this repo. That goes in the screw.nvim repo.
- Do NOT make the multi-LLM challenger active by default. It's always opt-in.
- Do NOT let the autoresearch loop auto-commit YAML changes. Human review gate is mandatory.
- Do NOT use the OWASP Benchmark (Java-only, synthetic) for validation. Use flawgarden/reality-check (real CVEs, multi-language).
